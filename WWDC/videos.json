Because Apple has already done practically all of the heavy lifting, it is unconscionable to fail blind and partially sighted users in this way. I will follow this with three examples of little known accessibility features that are in iOS that are often neglected or blocked by developers.

TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fast and modular, forming the core experience of many apps. At Yelp, we have more than 75 separate table views, including all of our most important screens. However, as powerful as UITableView can be, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all sunshine and roses. Table views bring in an additional level of complexity, which can quickly get out of hand. Back in 2009, we designed a common architecture for all of our table views to make them easier to use. It was succinct and powerful, aimed at addressing the difficulty of sizing variable-height cells. However, as the team grew from 2 engineers to the 12 we have now, our 6-year old framework started to show its age. It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t manage complexity well, and was tricky for new developers to learn. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be talking about what went wrong with the first architecture, and how we built those lessons into a new system. Our new architecture scales easily, from simple table views with only 1 cell class to complex ones with more than 25 unique cell types. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a much thinner wrapper over stock UITableViews, making it easier to understand for new developers. And it has encouraged modularity, allowing us to easily create complex views without writing new cells. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also discuss some of the tricks weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found along the way, such as using child view controllers inside of cells. Our new framework has worked spectacularly well for us, and has pushed the bounds of what we thought was possible with table views. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d love to share what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

I wouldn't say that the same can happen to everyone, but I've learned a lot on this journey the past few years that should illuminate what it's like to put your career in the hands of open source. That being said, here's my story: I started app development a few years ago, following the 'fake it 'till you make it' principle. I then published three truly terrible 'indie' apps, then talked my way into a job/internship with a tiny startup who had previously contracted out their iOS app. And then, one day, everything changed when I found an amazing open source framework that I began to use in my own apps. After meeting this library's maintainer, they let me start working on this really technical OSS library with nearly no experience with that sort of work. Then, last Spring, I picked up CocoaPods development on a whim when I got bored the first week of the quarter at college. I even got to spend three months working on CocoaPods full-time. I now work for a company whose product is open source. Along the way, I've picked up a real love of discovering the 'perfect' way to build stuff. And I've gotten to work on open source for a living. I've been living out a dream, but I'm sure you can apply some of the lessons I've learned to your own career.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

It's especially difficult these days to come up with app ideas that have the earning potential needed to sustain a business over the long term. Far too many developers have a great product idea, build it, and then are disappointed when sales don't follow. But a lot of these products fail in the market not because they're bad apps, but because their creators were thinking like programmers, and not like entrepreneurs. In this presentation, we'll explore the typical \"product first\" approach to app development that most developers employ, and why it so often leads to disappointment in the marketplace. Once we understand what doesn't work, we'll turn our attention to a \"market first\" approach that holds much more promise in creating app ideas that result in profit. You'll learn the most important factors in the success of a product (Spoiler alert: Your app's feature list isn't one of them.) and why niches are the name of the game. Along the way, you'll learn a framework for evaluating potential markets, and how to identify product ideas that customers are happy to pay for.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

The small decisions made along the way that contribute to success. We'll also talk about avoiding the common pitfalls of design for design's sake. Over-abundant animations, the obsession with \"clean\" interfaces that lack function, making our products so opinionated that only we like themÃ¢â‚¬â€all the things we designers tend to fawn over that don't matter much to most people. Finally, we'll talk about balancing the need to serve our customers' best interests, vs. our own needs to survive as a company. You can't build products for people, after all, if you go out of business. Successful design solves problems. Well designed products meet needs.

The success of the proposed ResearchKit widely depends on the users' participation and willingness to share large amount of information collected via mobile phone sensors. My proposed research kit helper will provide probabilistic data aggregation and query processing filters to minimise network traffic while still maintaining the quality of survey results. A number of quality adjustable query processing filters will be prebuilt as part of my ResearchKit helper and will be configurable via backend. The core features and strengths of the proposed ResearchKit Helper framework: - It will provide basic data processing filters. Researchers are not interested in bulk data (motion sensor or activity data from phone), rather statistically significant representative data will be produced. - A number of generic probabilistic models will be pre-built (e.g. Merge distributions) - This will enable the research community to engage larger audience. - Degree of participation will be higher as this will minimise the data traffic for research survey - Configurable data processing filters that can be adjusted from a remote backend. - Proposed framework will also facilitate anonymization of data for protecting user's privacy\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

As iOS developers we care for nice applications and good user experiences. Equally, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also often talked about user centric design, and hence keep their goals and expectations in mind, while trying to achieve our business goals. With this talk however IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to take the discussion a bit further from onboarding and hamburger menus, and more towards designing/developing for human experiences. Human experience is, in my opinion, centered around fitting into a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daily tasks, moods, and lifestyle, with the goal to enhance them. As is often said nowadays, phones are an extension of our every day lives, and as apps demanding time and attention, we should make sure to do so in the most natural and cohesive ways. This means taking it further than platform affordances. Our apps shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just fit into the style of the device, and other apps similar, it should fit into a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every day life. In order to do so, we need to better understand people, their interactions with mobile, and the extent to which design can affect moods and perception.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

The out-of-the-box tools are still a bit anemic and a lot of testing ends up being confined to unit testing because it's too much of a hassle, or too slow, to test what should be. I'd like to cover some improvements to how BDD can be done, using Cedar as an example, and several custom extensions to Objective-C's runtime (which would function in any testing environment). ('Try that in swift!' could be a subtitle for this talk. . . . ) Specifically, I'll cover how to intercede in the runtime to make time pass without waiting, to intercept & munge network communications (including with NSURLSession, which was more challenging than previous techniques), to collapse animations, and how to otherwise get Apple's systems out of the way to test what you want to. I'll also talk about what to test and what not to test, to dial in the level of coverage desired to fit the situation. The techniques covered include method swizzling and posing, so I selected 'advanced' above. But depending on the audience, I could focus on the more interesting and unusual tools or try to support a mechanism for making BDD testing drive good implementations. I'm pretty flexible. If this is the place to be less than humble, I've got a 5.0 rating on 'ratemyprofessor.com', won Berkeley's teaching award, and in general try to be entertaining.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

As iOS developers we care for nice applications and good user experiences. Equally, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also often talked about user centric design, and hence keep their goals and expectations in mind, while trying to achieve our business goals. With this talk however IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to take the discussion a bit further from onboarding and hamburger menus, and more towards designing/developing for human experiences. Human experience is, in my opinion, centered around fitting into a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daily tasks, moods, and lifestyle, with the goal to enhance them. As is often said nowadays, phones are an extension of our every day lives, and as apps demanding time and attention, we should make sure to do so in the most natural and cohesive ways. This means taking it further than platform affordances. Our apps shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just fit into the style of the device, and other apps similar, it should fit into a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every day life. In order to do so, we need to better understand people, their interactions with mobile, and the extent to which design can affect moods and perception.\n\n\n\nThis talk was recorded at AltConf 2015.

After graduating from Stanford with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and Product Design, she had firsthand knowledge of how significantly men outnumber women in science, technology, engineering and math.  Debbie then became obsessed with the notion of \"disrupting the pink aisle\" with a toy that would introduce girls to the joy of engineering at a young age.  Industry leaders told her the idea would fail, but less than three years after launching GoldieBlox on Kickstarter, she has made significant strides in her quest to bridge the gender gap in STEM:  she has launched massively successful viral videos, a Superbowl ad that brought mainstream awareness to her mission, an award-winning iOS app and GoldieBlox presence in more than 6,000 retail stores worldwide.  Debbie has also recently been selected to join the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, a select group 'committed to helping develop the next generation of entrepreneurs around the world.'
